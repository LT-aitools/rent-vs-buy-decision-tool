# Clear Session State Instructions

## Issue: Seeing Persistent User Override Tooltips

If you see "User Override" tooltips when they shouldn't appear (like for unsupported countries), this is due to Streamlit session state carrying over from previous tests.

## Solutions:

### Option 1: Hard Refresh Browser
- **Chrome/Firefox**: Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- **Safari**: Cmd+R
- This clears the browser cache and session state

### Option 2: Clear Session in App
Look for a "Clear Session" or "Reset" button in the app sidebar (if available)

### Option 3: Restart Streamlit (Done)
✅ The app has been restarted with a fresh session

## Test Again:

Now try entering **"Tbilisi, Georgia"** in the fresh app:

**Expected Result:**
```
✅ Market Appreciation Rate: 3.0% (no tooltips)
✅ Interest Rate: 7.0% (no tooltips) 
✅ Rent Increase Rate: 3.0% (no tooltips)
✅ Property Tax Rate: 1.2% (no tooltips)
✅ Inflation Rate: 3.0% (no tooltips)
```

**Should NOT see:**
❌ Blue "API Updated" indicators
❌ Orange "User Override" indicators

If you still see tooltips, do a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) on http://localhost:8501
