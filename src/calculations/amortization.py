Amortization Schedule Calculation Functions
Year-by-year loan balance tracking and payment breakdown

This module handles detailed amortization calculations including:
- Complete amortization schedule generation
- Year-by-year loan balance tracking
- Interest and principal payment breakdown
- Remaining balance calculations for any year

All calculations handle edge cases (0% interest, 100% down payment) properly.
