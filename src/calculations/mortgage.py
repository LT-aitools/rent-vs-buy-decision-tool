Mortgage and Loan Calculation Functions
Comprehensive mortgage payment calculations with edge case handling

This module handles all mortgage-related calculations including:
- Standard mortgage payment calculations using PMT formula
- Edge cases: 0% interest rates, 100% down payments
- Loan amount calculations and input validation
- Payment breakdowns and amortization basics

All formulas follow the Business PRD specifications exactly.
