================================================================
2. CALCULATION METHODOLOGIES
================================================================

2.1 PRIMARY ANALYSIS: TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP COMPARISON

Objective: Compare the total economic cost of renting versus owning over the analysis period.

2.1.1 PURCHASE SCENARIO ANNUAL CASH FLOWS

Year 1 Initial Costs:
Loan Amount = Purchase Price × (1 - Down Payment %)
Initial Investment = (Purchase Price × Down Payment %) + Transaction Costs + Moving Costs

Mortgage Payment Calculation:
If Down Payment % = 100%:
  Annual Mortgage Payment = 0
Else If Interest Rate = 0%:
  Monthly Payment = Loan Amount / (Loan Term × 12)
  Annual Mortgage Payment = Loan Amount / Loan Term
Else:
  Monthly Payment = PMT(Interest Rate/12, Loan Term × 12, -Loan Amount)
  Annual Mortgage Payment = Monthly Payment × 12

Annual Operating Costs (Years 1-N):
Note: Year-1 indexing means Year 1 uses base costs, escalation begins Year 2

Property Tax Base = Purchase Price (assessed value for tax purposes)
Property Taxes = Property Tax Base × Property Tax Rate × (1 + Property Tax Escalation Rate)^(Year-1)
Insurance = Insurance Cost × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Year-1)
Maintenance = Annual Maintenance × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Year-1)
Property Management = Property Management Fee × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Year-1)
CapEx Reserve = Purchase Price × Long-term CapEx Reserve × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Year-1)
Obsolescence Risk Cost = Purchase Price × Obsolescence Risk Factor × (1 + Inflation Rate)^(Year-1)
Property Upgrade Cost = 0 (except in Property Upgrade Cycle years)

Total Annual Cost (Ownership) = Annual Mortgage Payment + Property Taxes + Insurance + Maintenance + Property Management + CapEx Reserve + Obsolescence Risk Cost + Property Upgrade Cost

Amortization Schedule Calculation:
If Down Payment % = 100%:
  Remaining Loan Balance = 0 for all years
  Interest Portion = 0 for all years
Else:
  For Year N:
    Beginning Balance = Remaining loan balance from previous year (Year 0 = Loan Amount)
    Interest Portion = Beginning Balance × Interest Rate
    Principal Portion = Annual Mortgage Payment - Interest Portion
    Remaining Loan Balance = Beginning Balance - Principal Portion

Tax Benefits (if applicable):
Land Value = Purchase Price × Land Value %
Building Value = Purchase Price - Land Value
Depreciation Deduction = Building Value ÷ Depreciation Period
Property Tax Deduction = Property Taxes (if Property Tax Deductible = Yes)
Annual Tax Savings = (Interest Portion + Depreciation + Property Tax Deduction) × Corporate Tax Rate

Subletting Income Calculation:
Excess Space = MAX(0, Total Property Size - Current Space Needed)
Subletting Income = Excess Space × Subletting Rate × Subletting Occupancy (if Subletting Potential = Yes, else 0)

Property Upgrade Costs (Applied in Property Upgrade Cycle Years):
Original Building Value = Purchase Price - (Purchase Price × Land Value %)
If Year MOD Property Upgrade Cycle = 0:
  Property Upgrade Cost = Original Building Value × 2% (major renovation estimate)
Else:
  Property Upgrade Cost = 0

Net Annual Cost (Ownership) = Total Annual Cost - Annual Tax Savings - Subletting Income

2.1.2 RENTAL SCENARIO ANNUAL CASH FLOWS

Year 1 Initial Costs:
Initial Investment = Security Deposit + Rental Commission + Moving Costs

Rent Calculation Methodology:
Note: Year-1 indexing means Year 1 uses current rent, increases begin Year 2

Rent per Sq Meter (Year 1) = Current Annual Rent ÷ Current Space Needed
For Year N:
  Rent per Sq Meter = (Current Annual Rent ÷ Current Space Needed) × (1 + Rent Increase Rate)^(Year-1)
  Annual Rent = Current Space Needed × Rent per Sq Meter

Tax Benefits (if applicable):
Annual Tax Savings = Annual Rent × Corporate Tax Rate (if Rent Deductible = Yes)

Net Annual Cost (Rental) = Annual Rent - Annual Tax Savings

2.1.3 SPACE EXPANSION CALCULATIONS

When expansion is needed:
When expansion is needed in Future Expansion Year:

PURCHASE SCENARIO:
Available Space = Total Property Size - Current Space Needed
If Additional Space ≤ Available Space:
  Additional Space Cost = Additional Space × Space Improvement Cost
Else:
  Expansion requires new property acquisition or major renovation (outside scope)

RENTAL SCENARIO:
Additional Space Annual Cost = Additional Space × Rent per Sq Meter
Potential Relocation Cost = Moving Costs + Lease Break Penalty (if relocating to larger space)
Total Expansion Cost = Additional Space Annual Cost × Remaining Years in Analysis

Where Rent per Sq Meter = Current Annual Rent ÷ Current Space Needed

2.1.4 TERMINAL VALUE CALCULATIONS

At end of analysis period (hold-forever ownership assumption):

OWNERSHIP SCENARIO (Hold-Forever Wealth Accumulation):
Land Value = Purchase Price × Land Value %
Building Value = Purchase Price - Land Value

Land Value at End = Land Value × (1 + Market Appreciation Rate)^Analysis Period
Accumulated Depreciation = MIN(Building Value, Building Value × Analysis Period / Depreciation Period)
Depreciated Building Value = Building Value - Accumulated Depreciation
Building Value at End = Depreciated Building Value × (1 + Market Appreciation Rate)^Analysis Period
Terminal Property Value = Land Value at End + Building Value at End
Remaining Loan Balance = Outstanding mortgage balance at end of analysis period (from amortization schedule)
Net Property Equity = Terminal Property Value - Remaining Loan Balance

RENTAL SCENARIO:
Terminal Asset Value = 0 (no property ownership, no wealth accumulation)
Security Deposit Recovery = Security Deposit × (1 + Inflation Rate)^Analysis Period

For Hold-Forever Wealth Analysis:
Ownership Terminal Value = Net Property Equity (represents accumulated wealth from property ownership)
Rental Terminal Value = Security Deposit Recovery only (no property wealth accumulated)

Note: This analysis shows wealth accumulation difference - ownership builds equity through appreciation and debt paydown, while rental builds no property wealth.

2.2 NET PRESENT VALUE (NPV) ANALYSIS

Formula:
NPV Difference = NPV(Rental Cash Flows) - NPV(Ownership Cash Flows)

Where:
NPV = Σ[Cash Flow Year N ÷ (1 + Cost of Capital)^N] + Terminal Value ÷ (1 + Cost of Capital)^N

Positive NPV Difference = Ownership is financially better
Negative NPV Difference = Rental is financially better

2.3 BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS (OPERATIONAL FOCUS)

Methodology:
• Calculate annual cash flow difference each year (ownership vs rental operating costs)
• Identify the year when annual ownership costs become lower than annual rental costs  
• Calculate cumulative cost difference to determine total economic advantage
• Focus on operational break-even rather than including fictional sale proceeds

2.4 SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CALCULATIONS

Interest Rate Sensitivity:
• Test scenarios: Current Rate ±1%, ±2%, ±3%
• Recalculate NPV difference for each scenario
• Display impact on recommendation

Rent Increase Sensitivity:
• Test scenarios: Current Rate ±1%, ±2%, ±3%

• Highlight scenarios where recommendation changes

2.5 KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS (KPIs)

Primary Metrics:
1. NPV Difference: Total financial advantage of ownership vs rental over analysis period
2. Operational Break-Even Year: When annual ownership costs become lower than rental costs
3. Annual Cash Flow Impact: Year 1 cash flow difference
4. Total Cost Difference: Sum of all costs over analysis period

Secondary Metrics:
1. Cost per Square Meter: Annual cost divided by space utilized
2. Flexibility Premium: Cost of maintaining rental flexibility vs ownership control
3. Long-term Cost Stability: Predictability of ownership costs vs rental escalation
4. Capital Opportunity Cost: Returns foregone by investing in real estate vs other investments

3. OUTPUT DASHBOARD & REPORTING STRUCTURE
================================================================

3.1 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY DASHBOARD (Top Section)

Layout: 4-column metric cards with visual indicators

Metric Card          | Display Format              | Calculation           | Color Logic
Recommendation       | "BUY" or "RENT" + Confidence| Based on NPV difference | Green (Strong), Yellow (Weak), Red (Marginal)
NPV Advantage        | "$XXX,XXX over XX years"    | Absolute NPV difference | Green (Positive), Red (Negative)
Operational Break-Even| "X.X years" or "Never"      | When annual costs favor ownership | Green (<10 years), Yellow (10-15), Red (>15)
Year 1 Cash Impact   | "±$XXX,XXX difference"      | First year cash flow delta | Red (High cash need), Green (Cash positive)

Decision Logic for Recommendation (Hold-Forever Strategy):
Strong Buy: NPV > $1,000,000 AND Operational break-even < 10 years AND Total cost advantage > 15%
Weak Buy: NPV > $500,000 OR Operational break-even < 15 years OR Total cost advantage > 10%
Marginal: NPV between -$500,000 and $500,000 AND Total cost difference within ±10%
Weak Rent: NPV < -$500,000 OR Total cost advantage to rental > 10% over analysis period
Strong Rent: NPV < -$1,000,000 AND Total cost advantage to rental > 20% AND High flexibility value
