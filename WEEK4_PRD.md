## Technical Architecture

### Inter-Work Tree Interfaces

#### 1. Analytics ↔ User Experience
```python
# Analytics exposes analysis results
class AnalyticsResult:
    sensitivity_data: Dict
    scenario_comparisons: List[Dict]
    risk_assessment: Dict
    
# UX consumes via standardized interface
def render_sensitivity_analysis(analytics_result: AnalyticsResult)
```

#### 2. Data Integration ↔ Analytics
```python
# Data provides market context
class MarketData:
    rental_rates: Dict[str, float]
    property_values: Dict[str, float]
    interest_rates: List[float]
    
# Analytics integrates market data
def calculate_market_adjusted_npv(base_params: Dict, market_data: MarketData)
```

#### 3. Testing ↔ All Trees
```python
# Standardized testing interfaces for all components
class TestableComponent:
    def run_unit_tests(self) -> TestResults
    def validate_accuracy(self, test_cases: List[Dict]) -> ValidationResults
```

**Status**: Moved to backlog for future implementation
**Components Deferred**:
- `src/export/pdf/` - PDF report generation
- `src/export/excel/` - Excel export functionality
- Report templates and customization
- File download and email delivery

**Rationale**: Week 4 focuses on core analytical capabilities and user experience. Export functionality will be more valuable once advanced analytics are established.

## Work Tree Independence Strategy

### Git Branch Structure
```
main
├── feature/week4-analytics-engine      # Work Tree 1
├── feature/week4-user-experience       # Work Tree 2  
├── feature/week4-data-integration      # Work Tree 3
└── feature/week4-testing-qa            # Work Tree 4
```

### Sub-Agent Autonomy
1. **Clear Interfaces**: Each work tree has well-defined input/output contracts
2. **Mock Dependencies**: Sub-agents can develop against mocked interfaces
3. **Independent Testing**: Each tree has its own test suite
4. **Parallel Development**: Minimal dependencies between trees during development

### Integration Points
- **Daily Sync**: Interface validation and compatibility checks
- **Integration Branch**: `feature/week4-integration` for merging work
- **Shared Resources**: Common utilities in `src/shared/` directory
