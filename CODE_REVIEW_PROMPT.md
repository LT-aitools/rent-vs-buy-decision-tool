- [ ] **Year-1 Indexing**: All cost escalations use `(1 + rate)^(year-1)` pattern correctly
- [ ] **Hold-Forever Strategy**: Terminal value reflects wealth accumulation, NOT sale proceeds
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: All extreme scenarios handled without errors or crashes
- [ ] **Business PRD Formulas**: Every formula matches the approved Business PRD exactly
- [ ] **Input Field Mapping**: All 30+ input fields from PRD have corresponding calculation parameters

#### **UI Components Review:**
- [ ] **Complete Field Coverage**: All 37 input fields from Business PRD are implemented
- [ ] **Section Organization**: 6 sections match PRD structure exactly
- [ ] **Validation Rules**: Business logic validation matches PRD requirements  
- [ ] **Default Values**: All defaults match those specified in Business PRD
- [ ] **Professional Styling**: Executive-presentation ready appearance
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Works correctly on desktop, tablet, mobile

### **2. MATHEMATICAL ACCURACY VERIFICATION**

#### **Core Formula Validation:**
```python
# Verify these key calculations are implemented correctly:

# 1. Mortgage Payment with Edge Cases
if down_payment_pct >= 100:
    annual_payment = 0.0
elif interest_rate == 0:
    annual_payment = loan_amount / loan_term  
else:
    monthly_payment = np.pmt(interest_rate/12/100, loan_term*12, -loan_amount)
    annual_payment = monthly_payment * 12

# 2. Year-1 Indexing Pattern
annual_cost = base_cost * (1 + escalation_rate/100)**(year - 1)

# 3. Hold-Forever Terminal Value
land_value_end = land_value * (1 + market_appreciation/100)**analysis_period
accumulated_depreciation = min(building_value, building_value * analysis_period / depreciation_period)
building_value_end = max(0, (building_value - accumulated_depreciation) * (1 + appreciation/100)**analysis_period)
net_equity = (land_value_end + building_value_end) - remaining_loan_balance

# 4. NPV Calculation Structure
npv_ownership = sum(cash_flow / (1 + discount_rate)**year for year, cash_flow in enumerate(ownership_flows))
npv_rental = sum(cash_flow / (1 + discount_rate)**year for year, cash_flow in enumerate(rental_flows))
```

- [ ] **Error Information**: Error messages don't expose internal system details

#### **Production Readiness:**
- [ ] **Performance**: Calculations complete quickly even with large datasets
- [ ] **Scalability**: Code handles reasonable usage loads
- [ ] **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of unexpected errors
- [ ] **Logging**: Appropriate logging for debugging without exposing sensitive data
- [ ] **Configuration**: Hardcoded values are configurable where appropriate

### **5. INTEGRATION COMPATIBILITY**

#### **Data Flow Validation:**
- [ ] **Input Structure**: UI components output data in format calculations expect
- [ ] **Output Format**: Calculations return results in format UI can display
- [ ] **Session State**: UI session management compatible with calculation workflow
- [ ] **Error Propagation**: Calculation errors properly surface in UI
- [ ] **Performance**: UI remains responsive during calculations

#### **Component Dependencies:**
- [ ] **Import Structure**: Clean imports without circular dependencies
- [ ] **Shared Constants**: Common values defined in single location
- [ ] **Version Compatibility**: All dependencies are compatible
- [ ] **Environment Setup**: Requirements.txt includes all necessary packages

### **6. BUSINESS LOGIC VERIFICATION**
