# 🇺🇸 Enhanced US Market Data

## Current Status
Previously, the US only had **Interest Rate** from the FRED API (1 field).

## Enhancement Applied
Now the US provides **5 fields** with market data:

### ✅ **US Data Fields**
1. **Interest Rate**: 🔴 **Live FRED API** (e.g., 6.809% from Federal Reserve)
2. **Market Appreciation Rate**: 📊 **US Market Estimate** (3.5% - US national average)
3. **Rent Increase Rate**: 📊 **US Market Estimate** (3.2% - US national average)
4. **Property Tax Rate**: 📊 **US Market Estimate** (1.1% - US national average)
5. **Inflation Rate**: 📊 **US Market Estimate** (3.0% - US inflation target)

## Data Sources
- **Interest Rate**: Real-time from Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)
- **Other Fields**: US national averages and estimates (can be enhanced with additional APIs)

## Tooltip Behavior
**Expected for US**:
- **Interest Rate**: "🌐 API Updated: Federal Reserve (FRED) • 🔴 LIVE API"
- **Other Fields**: "🌐 API Updated: US Market Estimates • 📅 Data from 2024-08-14"

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
The US market estimates could be enhanced with:
- **Census Bureau APIs** for property data
- **Bureau of Labor Statistics** for inflation data  
- **Real estate APIs** (Zillow, Realtor.com) for market trends
- **State/local APIs** for property tax rates by location
